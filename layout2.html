          <p class="favourite-place-card-description">
            If there was just one symbol to represent all of India, it would be the Taj Mahal.
            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.
            The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $956 million).
            The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

          <p class="favourite-place-card-description">
            Amritsar is world-famous for the beautiful and highly revered Golden
            Temple.The gurdwara is built around a man-made pool (sarovar) that was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577.
            In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib.[2][7] The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and invading Afghan armies.
            Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, and overlaid the sanctum with Gold foil in 1830.
            This has led to the name the Golden Temple.

            The Mysore Palace is a historical palace and the royal residence at Mysore.
            The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, citadel), and is now known as the new Fort.
            Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was burnt ablaze and constructed multiple times.
            The old fort was constructed using wood and thus was the reason for the old fort to catch on fire, the current fort was made up of stone,bricks and wood.
            The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace was burnt ablaze.
